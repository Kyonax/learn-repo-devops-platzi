The responsibility model is not the same when you hace a Local Server ~ Cloud Services:

The Shared Responsibility model is a security and compliance framework that outlines the responsibilities of cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers for securing every aspect of the cloud environment, including hardware, infrastructure, endpoints, data, configurations, settings, operating systems (OS), network controls and access rights.
